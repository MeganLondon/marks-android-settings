#### DevslopesAndroid Theme Settings

*  I removed the blue collapse lines (thought they looked ugly)
*  Got rid of outlines and bolding of keywords
*  Made CMD+ make the font size increase and CMD- make the font size decrease
*  I turned off code folding - mostly because I don't like the way it looks when collapsed
*  Reduced total amount of colors
*  Stole some colors from Xcode :)
